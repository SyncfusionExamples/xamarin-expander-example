# Getting started

The Expander control provides a way to expand and collapse when tapping a header. This section provides a quick overview for working with the `SfExpander` for Xamarin.Forms. This section covers the minimal features that you need to know to get started with the Expander. 

This sample showcases the Syncfusion SfExpander for Xamarin.Forms, creating an organized and user-friendly interface for displaying details like an invoice. The layout is built within a ScrollView to ensure content remains scrollable on various screen sizes.

A StackLayout arranges three SfExpander controls vertically. Each expander acts as a collapsible section, allowing users to view a summary in the header and expand it to see detailed content.

This example effectively demonstrates how the SfExpander can manage and display complex data in a structured, space-efficient manner. The headers are customizable, and the content area can host any Xamarin.Forms layout, offering significant flexibility for building detailed and interactive UIs. By nesting controls like Grid within the expanderâ€™s content, developers can create sophisticated and well-organized interfaces.
